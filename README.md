# Early-Stage-Malware-Prediction-Using-Recurrent-Neural-Networks

For the implementation of the various techniques to
test a subject file as malicious or legitimate, I have
made the use of the following 2 datasets. The 2
datasets mentioned have been trained and tested using
various supervised learning models in Machine Learning
and have also been tried using Recurrent Neural
Networks that has been built from scratch.

1.CICIDS 2017 DATASET:
Many Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) has been proposed in the
current decade. To evaluate the effectiveness of the IDS Canadian
Institute of Cyber security presented a state of art dataset named
CICIDS2017, consisting of latest threats and features. The dataset
draws attention of many researchers as it represents threats which
were not addressed by the older datasets. While undertaking an
experimental research on CICIDS 2017, it has been found that the
dataset has few major shortcomings. These issues are sufficient
enough to bias the detection engine of any typical IDS. This paper
explores the detailed characteristics of CICIDS2017 dataset and
outlines issues inherent to it. Finally, it also presents a combined
dataset by eliminating such issues for better classification and
detection of any future intrusion detection engine.

2.DATA.CSV(CHOSEN BY THE USER):
Dataset downloaded from the Kaggle repository
containing details about the data with attributes such
as name, size of optional header, characteristics, major
linker version, minor linker version, size of code, size of
initialized data, size of uninitialized data, base of code,
base of data, image base etc and the final class label
that assigns the class name to a particular file as
malicious or legitimate.

WorkFlow of Data:
1. Data Collection/ Gathering
2. Data Analysis
3. Data Pre processing
4. Choosing the right dataset along with the dataset
provided for reference (CICIDS 2017)
5. Implementation of various Machine Learning
Algorithms including Random Forest, Gradient
Boosting, GNB (Gaussian Naïve Bayes), Decision
Trees (algorithm with the highest accuracy), Linear
Regression, Ada Boost
6. Implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNN) for the same problem statement, building
the code and logic of RNN from scratch
7. Implementation of LSTM and GRU(Gated Recurrent
Unit) for the input layer, middle layer(hidden),
output layer, building the code and logic of LSTM
and GRU from scratch.

CONTRIBUTION TO THE RESEARCH PAPER:

 In order to keep the novelty and uniqueness of
the project topic and its implementation
through the research paper, I have worked in
the R programming environment for analysis of
the dataset.
 Jupyter Notebook supports the configuration
of programming through R Kernel and import
the same into an existing Python environment.
 For the given dataset given as reference, I have
analyzed the dataset and simplified its
statistics for all the attributes present in the
dataset.
 I have read and imported the dataset from the
.csv file and print the summary of all its
attributes.
 I have printed the Confusion Matrix of all the
attributes present in the dataset using RNN
and Regression Trees.
 Based upon the RNN’s test and train data, I
have taken a small subset of the given dataset
and check it for validity.

 For further analysis, I have displayed all the
attributes and calculated the following
parameters for each one of them:
1.Minimum Value of each attribute
2.1st Quartile for each attribute
3.Median Value for each attribute
4.Mean Value for each attribute
5.3rd Quartile for each attribute
6.Maximum Value of each attribute
